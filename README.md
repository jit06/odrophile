# odrophile
Odroid based neo-retro audiophile tablet with leds vu-meter for Odroid C1+/C0 with Hifi Shield and HDMI touch screen (840x480).
The resolution can be changed if needed (boot.ini and /opt/volumiokiosk.sh).

How to build on an odroid C1+/C0 :
- get my custom volumio image
- clone this repo
- as root, run build.sh
